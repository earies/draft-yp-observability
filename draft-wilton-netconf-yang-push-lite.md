# Document Status

*RFC Editor: If present, please remove this section before publication.*
*RFC Editor: Please replace 'RFC XXXX' with the RFC number for this RFC.*

Based on the feedback received during the IETF 121 NETCONF session, this document has currently been written as a self-contained lightweight protocol and document replacement for {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, defining a separate configuration data model.

**The comparison between YANG Push and YANG Push Lite is now in {{DifferencesFromYangPush}}.**

**Open issues are either now being tracked inline in the text or in {{OpenIssuesTracker}} for the higher level issues.**

# Conventions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

All *YANG tree diagrams* used in this document follow the notation
defined in {{RFC8340}}.

# Introduction

{{I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration}} describes an architecture for how YANG datastore telemetry, e.g., {{RFC8641}}, can be integrated effectively with message brokers, e.g., {{Kafka}}, that forms part of a wider architecture for a *Network Anomaly Detection Framework*, specified in {{I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture}}.

This document specifies "YANG Push Lite", an lightweight alternative to Subscribed Notifications {{RFC8639}} and YANG Push {{RFC8641}}. YANG Push Lite is a separate YANG datastore telemetry solution, which can be implemented independently or, if desired, alongside {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}.

At a high level, YANG Push Lite is designed to solve a similar set of requirements as YANG Push, and it reuses a significant subset of the ideas and base solution from YANG Push.  YANG Push Lite defines a separate data model to allow concurrent implementation of both protocols and to facilitate more significant changes in behavior, but many of the data nodes are taken from YANG Push and have the same, or very similar definitions.

The following sections give the background for the solution, and highlight the key ways that this specification differs from the specifications that it is derived from.

## Background and Motivation for YANG Push Lite

A push based telemetry solution, as described both in this document and also the YANG Push solution described by {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, is beneficial because it allows operational data to be exported by publishers more immediately and efficiently compared to legacy poll based mechanisms, such as SNMP {{RFC3411}}.  Some further background information on the general motivations for push based telemetry, which equally apply here, can be found in the *Motivation* (section 1.1) of {{RFC8639}} and the Introduction (section 1) of {{RFC8641}}.  The remainder of this section is focused on the reasons why a new lightweight version of YANG Push has been specified, and what problems is aims to solve.

Early implementation efforts of the {{I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration}} architecture hit issues with using either of the two common YANG datastore telemetry solutions that have been specified, i.e., {{gNMI}} or YANG Push {{RFC8641}}.

gNMI is specified by the OpenConfig Industry Consortium.  It is more widely implemented, but operators report that some inter-operability issues between device implementations cause problems.  Many of the OpenConfig protocols and data models are also expected to evolve more rapidly than IETF protocols and models - that are expected to have a more gradual pace of evolution once an RFC has been published.

YANG Push {{RFC8641}} was standardized by the IETF in 2019, but market adoption has been rather slow.  During 2023/2024, when vendors started implementing, or considering implementing, YANG Push, it was seen that some design choices for how particular features have been specified in the solution make it expensive and difficult to write performant implementations, particularly when considering the complexities and distributed nature of operational data.  In addition, some design choices of how the data is encoded (e.g., YANG Patch {{RFC8072}}) make more sense when considering changes in configuration data but less sense when the goal is to export a subset of the operational data off the device in an efficient fashion for both devices (publishers) and clients (receivers).

Hence, during 2024, the vendors and operators working towards YANG telemetry solutions agreed to a plan to implement a subset of {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, including common agreements of features that are not needed and would not be implemented, and deviations from the standards for some aspects of encoding YANG data.  In addition, the implementation efforts identified the minimal subset of functionality needed to support the initial telemetry use cases, and areas of potential improvement and optimization to the overall YANG Push telemetry solution (which has been written up as a set of small internet drafts that augment or extend the base YANG Push solution).

Out of this work, consensus was building to specify a cut down version of Subscribed Notifications {{RFC8639}} and YANG Push {{RFC8641}} that is both more focussed on the operational telemetry use case and is also easier to implement, achieved by relaxing some of the constraints on consistency on the device, and removing, or simplifying some of the operational features.  This has resulted in this specification, YANG Push Lite.

The implementation efforts also gave rise to potential improvements to the protocol and encoding of notification messages.

## Complexities in Modelling the Operational State Datastore {#OperationalModellingComplexities}

The YANG abstraction of a single datastore of related consistent data works very well for configuration that has a strong requirement to be self consistent, and that is always updated, and validated, in a transactional way.  But for producers of telemetry data, the YANG abstraction of a single operational datastore is not really possible for devices managing a non-trivial quantity of operational data.

Some systems may store their operational data in a single logical database, yet it is less likely that the operational data can always be updated in a transactional way, and often for memory efficiency reasons such a database does not store individual leaves, but instead semi-consistent records of data at a container or list entry level.

For other systems, the operational information may be distributed across multiple internal nodes (e.g., linecards), and potentially many different process daemons within those distributed nodes.  Such systems generally do not, and cannot, exhibit full consistency {{Consistency}} of the operational data (which would require transactional semantics across all daemons and internal nodes), only offering an eventually consistent {{EventualConsistency}} view of the data instead.

In practice, many network devices will manage their operational data as a combination of some data being stored in a central operational datastore, and other, higher scale, and potentially more frequently changing data (e.g., statistics or FIB information) being stored elsewhere in a more memory efficient and performant way.

## Complexities for Consumers of YANG Push Data

For the consumer of the telemetry data, there is a requirement to associate a schema with the instance-data that will be provided by a subscription.  One approach is to fetch and build the entire schema for the device, e.g., by fetching YANG library, and then use the subscription XPath to select the relevant subtree of the schema that applies only to the subscription.  The problem with this approach is that if the schema ever changes, e.g., after a software update, then it is reasonably likely of some changes occurring with the global device schema even if there are no changes to the schema subtree under the subscription path.  Hence, it would be helpful to identify and version the schema associated with a particular subscription path, and also to encoded the instance data relatively to the subscription path rather than as an absolute path from the root of the operational datastore.

**TODO More needs to be added here, e.g., encoding, on-change considerations.  Splitting subscriptions up.**

This document proposes a new opt-in YANG-Push encoding format to use instead of the "push-update" and "push-change-update" notifications defined in {{RFC8641}}.

1. To allow the device to split a subscription into smaller child subscriptions for more efficient independent and concurrent processing.  I.e., reusing the ideas from {{?I-D.ietf-netconf-distributed-notif}}.  However, all child subscriptions are still encoded from the same subscription point.

### Combined periodic and on-change subscription

Sometimes it is helpful to have a single subscription that covers both periodic and on-change notifications.

There are two ways in which this may be useful:

1. For generally slow changing data (e.g., a device's physical inventory), then on-change notifications may be most appropriate.  However, in case there is any lost notification that isn't always detected, for any reason, then it may also be helpful to have a slow cadence periodic backup notification of the data (e.g., once every 24 hours), to ensure that the management systems should always eventually converge on the current state in the network.

1. For data that is generally polled on a periodic basis (e.g., once every 10 minutes) and put into a time series database, then it may be helpful for some data trees to also get more immediate notifications that the data has changed.  Hence, a combined periodic and on-change subscription, would facilitate more frequent notifications of changes of the state, to reduce the need of having to always wait for the next periodic event.

Hence, this document introduces the fairly intuitive "periodic-and-on-change" update trigger that creates a combined periodic and on-change subscription, and allows the same parameters to be configured.  For some use cases, e.g., where a time-series database is being updated, the new encoding format proposed previously may be most useful.

## Relationships to existing RFCs and Internet Drafts {#DraftRelationships}

This document, specifying YANG Push Lite, is intended to be a lightweight alternative for {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, but that also incorporates various extensions since those RFCs were written.  Often substantial parts of those documents and models have been incorporated almost verbatim, but modified to fit the YANG Push Lite functionality and module structure.

Hence, the authors of this draft would like to sincerely thank and acknowledge the very significant effort put into those RFCs and drafts by authors, contributors and reviewers.  In particular, We would like to thank the listed authors of these documents: Eric Voit, Alex Clemm, Alberto Gonzalez Prieto, Einar Nilsen-Nygaard, Ambika Prasad Tripathy, Balazs Lengyel, Alexander Clemm, Benoit Claise, Qin Wu, Qiufang Ma, Alex Huang Feng, Thomas Graf, Pierre Francois.

### RFC 8639 and RFC 8641

This document is primarily intended to be a lightweight alternative for {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, but it intentionally reuses substantial parts of the design and data model of those RFCs.

YANG Push Lite is defined using a separate module namespace, and hence can be implemented independently or, if desired, alongside {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}, and the various extensions to YANG Push.

A more complete description of the main differences in YANG Push Lite compares to {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}} is given in {{DifferencesFromYangPush}}.

### {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-notif-envelope}} and RFC 5277

All of the notifications defined in this specification, i.e., both the datastore update message and subscription lifecycle update notifications ({{LifecycleNotifications}}) depend upon and use the notification envelope format defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-notif-envelope}}.

As such, this specification does not make any use of the notification format defined in {{RFC5277}}, but this does not prevent implementations using {{RFC5277}} format notifications for other YANG notifications, e.g., for the "NETCONF" event stream defined in {{RFC5277}}.

### RFC 9196 and {{I-D.draft-netana-netconf-yp-transport-capabilities}}

This document uses the capabilities concepts defined in {{RFC9196}}.

In particular, it augments into the ietf-system-capabilities YANG module, but defines an equivalent alternative capability structure for the ietf-notification-capabilities YANG module, which defines the capabilities for YANG Push {{RFC8641}}.

The generic transport capabilities defined in {{I-D.draft-netana-netconf-yp-transport-capabilities}} have been incorporated into the ietf-yp-lite YANG module, to augment YANG Push Lite transport capabilities and to use the different identities.

### {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}} and {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif}}

The ietf-yp-lite YANG module has subsumed and extended the *receivers* data model defined in the ietf-subscribed-notif-receivers YANG module defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-https-notif}}.

The overall YANG Push Lite solution anticipates and requires new bis versions of both of these transports documents that augment into the *receivers/receiver/transport-type* choice statement, and also augment the transport identity defined in the ietf-yp-lite data model.

### {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-distributed-notif}}

**TODO.  It is likely that some of the base support for distributed notifications will be incorporated into this draft.  If so, add acknowledgements to the authors.**

# YANG Push Lite Overview {#overview}

This document specifies a lightweight telemetry solution that provides a subscription service for updates to the state and changes in state from a chosen datastore.

Subscriptions specify when notification messages (also referred to as *updates*) should be sent, what data to include in the update records, and where those notifications should be sent.

A YANG Push lite subscription comprises:

- a target datastore for the subscription, where the monitored subscription data is logically sourced from.

- a set of selection filters to choose which datastore nodes from the target datastore the subscription is monitoring or sampling, as described in {{pathsAndFilters}}.

- a choice of how update event notifications for the datastore's data nodes are triggered.  I.e., either periodic sampling of the current state, on-change event-driven, or both.  These are described in **TODO, add reference**.

- a choice of encoding of the messages, e.g., JSON, or CBOR.

- a set of one or more receivers for which datastore updates and subscription notifications are sent, as described in {{receivers}};
  - for configured subscriptions, the receivers parameters are configured, and specify transport, receiver, and encoding parameters.
  - for dynamic subscriptions, the receiver uses the same transport session on which the dynamic subscription has been created.

If a subscription is valid and acceptable to the publisher, and if a suitable connection can be made to one or more receivers associated with a subscription, then the publisher will enact the subscription, periodically sampling or monitoring changes to the chosen datastore's data nodes that match the selection filter.  Push updates are subsequently sent by the publisher to the receivers, as per the terms of the subscription.

Subscriptions may be set up in two ways: either through configuration - or YANG RPCs to create and manage dynamic subscriptions.  These two mechanisms are described in {{ConfiguredAndDynamic}}.

Changes to the state of subscription are notified to receivers as subscription lifecycle notifications.  These are described in {{LifecycleNotifications}}.

Security access control mechanisms, e.g., NACM {RFC8341}} can be used to ensure the receivers only get access to the information for which they are allowed.  This is further described in {{security}}.

While the functionality defined in this document is transport agnostic, transports like the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) {{RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{RFC8040}} can be used to configure or dynamically signal subscriptions.  In the case of configured subscription, the transport used for carrying the subscription notifications is entirely independent from the protocol used to configure the subscription, and other transports, e.g., {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif}} defines a simple UDP based transport for Push notifications. Transport considerations are described in {{transports}}. **TODO the reference to draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif isn't right, it wouldn't be that draft, but a -bis version of it.  James is querying whether we need this at all**

**TODO Introduce capabilities and operational monitoring**

This document defines a YANG data model, that includes RPCs and notifications, for configuring and managing subscriptions and associated configuration, and to define the format of a *update* notification message.  The YANG model is defined in {{yp-lite-yang-module}} and associated tree view in {{yp-lite-tree}}.  The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

# Definitions {#terminology}

This document reuses the terminology defined in {{RFC7950}}, {{RFC8341}}, {{RFC8342}}, {{RFC8639}} and {{RFC8641}}.

The following terms are taken from {{RFC8342}}:

- *Datastore*: A conceptual place to store and access information.  A datastore might be implemented, for example, using files, a database, flash memory locations, or combinations thereof.  A datastore maps to an instantiated YANG data tree.

- *Client*: An entity that can access YANG-defined data on a server, over some network management protocol.

- *Configuration*: Data that is required to get a device from its initial default state into a desired operational state.  This data is modeled in YANG using "config true" nodes.  Configuration can originate from different sources.

- *Configuration datastore*: A datastore holding configuration.

The following terms are taken from {{RFC8639}}:

- *Configured subscription*: A subscription installed via configuration into a configuration datastore.

- *Dynamic subscription*: A subscription created dynamically by a subscriber via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC).

- *Event*: An occurrence of something that may be of interest.  Examples include a configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a threshold, or an external input to the system.

- *Event occurrence time*: A timestamp matching the time an originating process identified as when an event happened.

- *Event record*: A set of information detailing an event.

- *Event stream*: A continuous, chronologically ordered set of events aggregated under some context.

- *Event stream filter*: Evaluation criteria that may be applied against event records in an event stream.  Event records pass the filter when specified criteria are met.

- *Notification message*: Information intended for a receiver indicating that one or more events have occurred.

- *Publisher*: An entity responsible for streaming notification messages per the terms of a subscription.

- *Receiver*: A target to which a publisher pushes subscribed event records.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same entity.

- *Subscriber*: A client able to request and negotiate a contract for the generation and push of event records from a publisher.  For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber are the same entity.

The following terms are taken from {{RFC8641}}:

- *Datastore node*: A node in the instantiated YANG data tree associated with a datastore.  In this document, datastore nodes are often also simply referred to as "objects".

- *Datastore node update*: A data item containing the current value of a datastore node at the time the datastore node update was created, as well as the path to the datastore node.

- *Datastore subscription*: A subscription to a stream of datastore node updates.

- *Datastore subtree*: A datastore node and all its descendant datastore nodes.

- *On-change subscription*: A datastore subscription with updates that are triggered when changes in subscribed datastore nodes are detected.

- *Periodic subscription*: A datastore subscription with updates that are triggered periodically according to some time interval.

- *Selection filter*: Evaluation and/or selection criteria that may be applied against a targeted set of objects.

- *Update record*: A representation of one or more datastore node updates.  In addition, an update record may contain which type of update led to the datastore node update (e.g., whether the datastore node was added, changed, or deleted).  Also included in the update record may be other metadata, such as a subscription ID of the subscription for which the update record was generated.  In this document, update records are often also simply referred to as "updates".

- *Update trigger*: A mechanism that determines when an update record needs to be generated.

- *YANG-Push*: The subscription and push mechanism for datastore updates that is specified in {{RFC8641}}.

This document introduces the following terms:

- *Subscription*: A registration with a publisher, stipulating the information that one or more receivers wish to have pushed from the publisher without the need for further solicitation.

- *Subscription Identifier*: A numerical identifier for a configured or dynamic subscription.  Also referred to as the subscription-id.

- *YANG-Push-Lite*: The light weight subscription and push mechanism for datastore updates that is specified in this document. **Add comment**

# Subscription paths and selection filters {#pathsAndFilters}

A key part of a subscription is to select which data nodes should be monitored, and so a subscription must specify both the selection filters and the datastore against which these selection filters will be applied.  This information is used to choose, and subsequently push, *update* notifications from the publisher's datastore(s) to the subscription's receiver(s).

Filters can either be defined inline within a configured subscription ({{SubscriptionYangTree}}), a dynamic subscription's *establish-subscription* RPC ({{EstablishSubscriptionYangTree}}), or as part of the *datastore-telemetry/filters* container ({{FilterContainerYangTree}}) which can then be referenced from a configured or dynamic subscription.

The following selection filter types are included in the YANG Push Lite data model and may be applied against a datastore:

- *YPaths*: A list of basic YANG path selection filters that defines a path to a subtree of data nodes in the data tree, with some simple constraints on keys. See {{YPaths}}.

- *subtree*: A subtree selection filter identifies one or more datastore subtrees.  When specified, *update* records will only include the datastore nodes of selected datastore subtree(s).  The syntax and semantics correspond to those specified in {{RFC6241}}, Section 6.

- *XPaths*: A list of *XPath* ({{XPATH}}) selection filter expressions.  When specified, updates will only come from the selected datastore nodes that match the node set associated with the XPath expression.

These filters are used as selectors that define which data nodes fall within the scope of a subscription.  A publisher MUST support YPath filters, and MAY also support subtree or XPath filters.

For both YPath and XPath based filters, each filter may define a list of path expressions.  Each of these filter path expressions MAY be processed by the publisher independently, and if two or more filter path expressions end up selecting overlapping data nodes then the publisher MAY notify duplicate values for those data nodes, but the encoded data that is returned MUST always be syntactically valid, i.e., as per section 5.3 of {{RFC8342}}.

## *YPath* definition {#YPaths}

A *YPath* represents a simple path into a YANG schema tree, where some of the list key values may be constrained.

It is encoded in the similar format to the YANG JSON encoding for instance-identifier, section 6.11 of {{RFC7951}}, except with more flexibility on the keys, in that keys may be left-out or be bound to a regular expression filter.

The rules for constructing a YPath are:

- A YPath is a sequence of data tree path segment separated by a '/' character.  If the path starts with a '/' then it is absolute path from the root of the schema, otherwise it is a relative path, where the context of the relative path must be declared.

- Constraints on key values may be specified within a single pair of '\[' '\]' brackets, where:

  - keys may be given in any order, and may be omitted, in which case they match any value.  Key matches are separated by a comma (,) with optional space character either side.

  - key match is given by *\<key\>=\<value\>*, with optional space characters either side of the equals (=), and value is specified as:

    - '\<value\>', for an exact match of the key's value.  Single quote characters (') must be escaped with a backslash (\\).

    - r'\<reg-expr\>', for a regex match of the key value using {{RFC9485}}, and where the regular-expression is a full match of the string, i.e, it implicit anchors to the start and end of the value.

Some examples of YPaths:

- */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface\[name='eth0'\]/ietf-ip:ipv6/ip* - which identifies is 'ipv6/ip' data node in the ietf-ip module for the 'eth0' interface.

- */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface\[name=r'eth.\*'\]/ietf-ip:ipv6/ip* - which identifies all interfaces with a name that start with "eth".

- */example:multi-keys-list\[first-key='foo', second-key=r'bar.\*'\]* - which identifies all entries in the 'multi-keys-list, where the first-key matches foo, and the second-key starts with bar.

- */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface* - which identifies the *interface* list data node in the ietf-interfaces module for all interfaces.  I.e., the interface list 'name' key is unrestricted.

- */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface\[\]* - alternative form of the previous YPath.

## The "filters" Container

The "filters" container maintains a list of all datastore subscription filters that persist outside the lifecycle of a single subscription.  This enables predefined filters that may be referenced by more than one configured or dynamic subscription.

Below is a tree diagram for the "filters" container.  All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in {{ietf-yp-lite-yang}}.

## Decomposing Subscription Filters

In order to address the issues described in {{OperationalModellingComplexities}}, YANG Push Lite allows for publishers to send subtrees of data nodes in separate *update* notifications, rather than requiring that the subscription data be returned as a single datastore *update* notification covering all data nodes matched by the subscription filter.  This better facilitates publishers that internally group some of their operational data fields together into larger structures for efficiency, and avoids publishers or receivers having to consume potentially very large notification messages.  For example, each entry in the */ietf-interfaces:interface/interface* list could be represented as an object of data internally within the publisher.  In essence, a client specified subscription filter can be decomposed by a publisher into more specific non-overlapping filters that are then used to return the data.

In particular:

1. A Publisher MAY decompose a client specified subscription filter path into a set of non-overlapping subscription filter paths that collectively cover the same data.  The publisher is allowed to return data for each of these decomposed subscription filter paths in separate *update* notification messages, each with separate, perhaps more precise, *observation-time* timestamps, but all using the same notification *event-time*.

1. A Publisher MAY split large lists into multiple separate update messages, each with separate *observation-time* timestamps, but all using the same notification *event-time*.  E.g., if a device has 10,000 entries in a list, it may return them in a single response, or it may split them into multiple smaller messages, perhaps for 500 interfaces at a time.

<!--
1. A Publisher is allowed to generate on-change notifications at an *object* level, which hence may contain other associated fields that may not have changed state, rather than restricting the on-change notifications strictly to only those specific fields that have changed state.  E.g., if a subscribers registers on the path */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface\[name = \*\]/oper-status*, and if interface *eth1* had a change in the *oper-status* leaf state, then rather than just publishing the updated *oper-status* leaf, the publisher may instead publish all the data associated with that interface entry object, i.e., everything under */ietf-interfaces:interface/interface\[name = eth1\]*.  **TODO Does it have to be the entire subtree that is published?  Do we need to add a capability annotation to indicate the object publication paths?**
-->

To ensure that clients can reasonably process data returned via decomposed filters then:

1. *update* notifications MUST indicate the precise subtree of data that the update message is updating or replacing, i.e., so a receiver can infer that data nodes no longer being notified by the publisher have been deleted:

   - if we support splitting list entries in multiple updates, then something like a *more_data* flag is needed to indicate that the given update message is not complete.

# Datastore Event Streams {#events}

In YANG Push Lite, a subscription, based on the selected filters, will generate a ordered stream of datastore *update* records that is referred to as an event stream.  Each subscription logically has a different event stream of update records, even if multiple subscriptions use the same filters to select datastore nodes.

As YANG-defined event records are created by a system, they may be assigned to one or more streams.  The event record is distributed to a subscription's receiver(s) where (1) a subscription includes the identified stream and (2) subscription filtering does not exclude the event record from that receiver.

Access control permissions may be used to silently exclude event records from an event stream for which the receiver has no read access.  See [RFC8341], Section 3.4.6 for an example of how this might be accomplished.  Note that per Section 2.7 of this document, subscription state change notifications are never filtered out. **TODO, filtering and NACM filtering should be dependent on whether it is a configured or dynamic subscription.**

If subscriber permissions change during the lifecycle of a subscription and event stream access is no longer permitted, then the subscription MUST be terminated. **TODO, check this**

Event records SHALL be sent to a receiver in the order in which they were generated.  I.e., the publisher MUST not reorder the events when enqueuing notifications on the transport session, but there is no guarantee of delivery order.

Event records MUST NOT be sent before a *subscription-started* notification ({{SubscriptionStartedNotification}}) or after a *subscription-terminated* notification ({{SubscriptionTerminatedNotification}}), or to a particular receiver that has been sent a *receiver-disconnected* notification ({{ReceiverDisconnectedNotification}}).

## Notification Envelope {#FullNotificationExample}

All notifications in the event stream MUST be encoded using {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-notif-envelope}} to wrap the notification message, and MUST include the *event-time*, *hostname*, and *sequence-number* leafs in all messages.

The following example illustrates a fully encoded *update* notification that includes the notification envelope and additional meta-data fields.  The *update* notification, i.e., as defined via the *notification* statement in the yang-push-lite YANG module, is carried in the *contents* anydata data node.

~~~~ json
{::include examples/full-notification.json.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="Example of update notification including notification envelope"}

## Event Records {#EventRecords}

A single *update* record is used for all datastore notifications.  It is used to report the current state of a set of data nodes at a given target path for either periodic, on-change, or resync notifications, and also for on-change notifications to indicate that the data node at the given target path has been deleted.

The schema for this notifications is given in the following tree diagram:

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/update-notification.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="'update' notification"}

The normative definitions for the notifications fields are given in the YANG module in {{ietf-yp-lite-yang}}.  The fields can be informatively summarized as:

- *id* - identifies the subscription the notification relates to.

- *path-prefix* - identifies the absolute instance-data path to which all target-paths are data are encoded relative to.

- *snapshot-type* - this indicates what type of event causes the update message to be sent.  I.e., a periodic collection, an on-change event, or a resync collection.

- *observation-time* - the time that the data was sampled, or when the on-change event occurred that caused the message to be published.

- *target-path* - identifies the data node that is being acted on, either providing the replacement data for, or that data node that is being deleted.

- *data* - the full replacement data subtree for the content at the target-path, encoded from the path-prefix.

- *complete* - if present, this flag indicates that a periodic collection (**TODO, what about on-change**) is complete. Setting this flag is semantically equivalent to the server sending a separate update-complete notification.

<!--
- *incomplete* - indicates that the message is incomplete for any reason.  For example, perhaps a periodic subscription expects to retrieve data from multiple data sources, but one of those data sources is unavailable.  Normally, a receiver can use the absence of a field in an update message to implicitly indicate that the field has been deleted, but that should not be inferred if the incomplete-update leaf is present because not all changes that have occurred since the last update are actually included with this update.-->

As per the structure of the *update* notification, a single notification MAY provide updates for multiple target-paths.

## Types of subscription event monitoring

Subscription can either be based on sampling the requested data on a periodic cadence or being notified when the requested data changes.  In addition, this specification allows for subscriptions that both notify on-change and also with a periodic cadence, which can help ensure that the system eventually converges on the right state, even if on-change notification were somehow lost or mis-processed anywhere in the data processing pipeline.

The schema for the update-trigger container is given in the following tree diagram:

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/update-trigger.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="'update-trigger' container"}

The normative definitions for the update-trigger fields are given in the *ietf-yp-lite* YANG module in {{ietf-yp-lite-yang}}.  They are also described in the following sections.

## Periodic events

In a periodic subscription, the data included as part of an update record corresponds to data that could have been read using a retrieval operation.  Only the state that exists in the system at the time that it is being read is reported, periodic updates never explicitly indicate whether any data-nodes or list entries have been deleted.  Instead, receivers must infer deletions by the absence of data during a particular collection event.

For periodic subscriptions, triggered updates will occur at the boundaries of a specified time interval.  These boundaries can be calculated from the periodic parameters:

- a *period* that defines the duration between push updates.

- an *anchor-time*; update intervals fall on the points in time that are a multiple of a *period* from an *anchor-time*.  If an *anchor-time* is not provided, then the publisher chooses a suitable anchor-time, e.g., perhaps the time that the subscription was first instantiated by the publisher.

The anchor time and period are particularly useful, in fact required, for when the collected telemetry data is being stored in a time-series database and the subscription is setup to ensure that each collection is placed in a separate time-interval bucket.

Periodic update notifications are expected, but not required, to use a single *target-path* per *update* notification.

## On-Change events

In an on-change subscription, *update* records indicate updated values or when a monitored data node or list node has been deleted.  An *update* record is sent whenever a change in the subscribed information is detected. *update* records SHOULD be generated at the same subtree as equivalent periodic subscription rather than only the specific data node that is on-change notifiable.  The goal is to ensure that the *update* message contains a consistent set of data on the subscription path.

Each entry in the *updates* list identifies a data node (i.e., list entry, container, leaf or leaf-list), via the *target-path* that either has changes is state or has been deleted.

A delete of a specific individual data node or subtree may be notified in two different ways:

- if the data that is being deleted is below the *target-path* then the delete is implicit by the publisher returning the current data node subtree with the delete data nodes missing.  I.e., the receiver must implicitly infer deletion.

- if the data node is being deleted at the target path.  E.g., if an interface is deleted then an entire list entry related to that interface may be removed.  In this case, the *target path* identifies the list entry that is being deleted, but the data returned is just an empty object ```{}```, which replaces all the existing data for that object in the receiver. **TODO, is this better as a delete flag, or separate delete list?**

On-change subscriptions also support the following additional parameters:

- *sync-on-start* defines whether or not a complete snapshot of all subscribed data is sent at the start of a subscription.  Such early synchronization establishes the frame of reference for subsequent updates.  For each data node covered by an on-change with sync-on-start subscription, then an *sync-on-start* *update* notification containing the current state MUST be sent before any on-change *update* notifications for those same data nodes.  However, *sync-on-start* and *on-change* *update* notifications may be interleaved for different data-nodes under the subscription.  Unsolicited *sync-on-start update* notifications MUST NOT be sent, they MUST only be sent after a subscription has started.


### On-Change Notifiable Datastore Nodes {#OnChangeConsiderations}

Publishers are not required to support on-change notifications for all data nodes, and they may not be able to generate on-change updates for some data nodes.  Possible reasons for this include:

- the value of the datastore node changes frequently (e.g., the in-octets counter as defined in {{RFC8343}}),

- small object changes that are frequent and meaningless (e.g., a temperature gauge changing 0.1 degrees),

- or no implementation is available to generate a notification when the source variable for a particular data node has changed.

In addition, publishers are not required to notify every change or value for an on-change monitored data node.  Instead, publishers MAY limit the rate at which changes are reported for a given data node, i.e., effectively deciding the interval at which an underlying value is sampled.  If a data node changes value and then reverts back to the original value within a sample interval then the publisher MAY not detect the change and it would go unreported.  However, if the data node changes to a new value after it has been sampled, then the change and latest state are reported to the receiver.  In addition, if a client was to query the value (e.g., through a NETCONF get-data RPC) then they MUST see the same observed value as would be notified.

To give an example, if the interface link state reported by hardware is changing state hundreds of times per second, then it would be entirely reasonable to limit those interface state changes to a much lower cadence, e.g., perhaps every 100 milliseconds.  In the particular case of interfaces, there may also be data model specific forms of more advanced dampening that are more appropriate, e.g., that notify interface down events immediately, but rate limit how quickly the interface is allowed to transition to up state, which overall acts as a limit on the rate at which the interface state may change, and hence also act as a limit on the rate at which on-change notifications could be generated.

The information about what nodes support on-change notifications is reported using capabilities operational data model.  This is further described in {{ConformanceAndCapabilities}}.

### On-Change Considerations

On-change subscriptions allow receivers to receive updates whenever changes to targeted objects occur.  As such, on-change subscriptions are particularly effective for data that changes infrequently but for which applications need to be quickly notified, with minimal delay, whenever a change does occur.

On-change subscriptions tend to be more difficult to implement than periodic subscriptions.  Accordingly, on-change subscriptions may not be supported by all implementations or for every object.

Whether or not to accept or reject on-change subscription requests when the scope of the subscription contains objects for which on-change is not supported is up to the publisher implementation.  A publisher MAY accept an on-change subscription even when the scope of the subscription contains objects for which on-change is not supported.  In that case, updates are sent only for those objects within the scope of the subscription that do support on-change updates, whereas other objects are excluded from update records, even if their values change.  In order for a subscriber to determine whether objects support on-change subscriptions, objects are marked accordingly on a publisher.  Accordingly, when subscribing, it is the responsibility of the subscriber to ensure that it is aware of which objects support on-change and which do not.  For more on how objects are so marked, see Section 3.10. **TODO Is this paragraph and the one below still the right choice for YANG Push Lite?**

Alternatively, a publisher MAY decide to simply reject an on-change subscription if the scope of the subscription contains objects for which on-change is not supported.  In the case of a configured subscription, the publisher MAY suspend the subscription.

## Combined periodic and on-change subscriptions

A single subscription may created to generate notifications both when changes occur and on a periodic cadence.  Such subscriptions are equivalent to having separate periodic and on-change subscriptions on the same path, except that they share the same subscription-id and filter paths.

## Streaming Update Examples

# Receivers, Transports, and Encodings {#ReceiversEtAl}

## Receivers
Every subscription is associated with one or more receivers, which each identify the destination host, transport and encoding settings, where all notifications for a subscription are sent.

For configured subscriptions there is no explicit association with an existing transport session, and hence the properties associated with the receiver are explicitly configured, as described in {{ConfiguredReceivers}}.

For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver, and most associated properties are implicit from the session on which the dynamic subscription was initiated, as described in {{DynamicSubscriptionReceivers}}.

### Receivers for Configured Subscriptions {#ConfiguredReceivers}

For configured subscriptions, receivers are configured independently from the subscriptions and then referenced from the subscription configuration.

Configured subscriptions MAY have multiple receivers, e.g., to facilitate redundancy.  Each receiver MAY be configured with different transports and associated transport settings, but they MUST all share the same encoding.

All subscription notifications, including lifecycle notifications ({{LifecycleNotifications}}), are sent to all receivers except for the *receiver-disconnected* notification, which is only sent to the affected receiver, and only if the subscription remains active because of other active receivers.

Below is a tree diagram for *datastore-telemetry/receivers* container. All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in {{yp-lite-yang-module}}.

These parameters identify how to connect to each receiver.  For each subscription, the publisher uses the referenced receiver configuration to establish transport connectivity to the receiver.

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/receivers.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="datastore-telemetry/receivers container" #ReceiversYangTree }

Each configured receiver has the following associated properties:

- a *name* to identify and reference the receiver in the subscription configuration.

- a *transport*, which identifies the transport protocol to use for all connections to the receiver.

  - any transport-specific related parameters, some of which may be mandatory, others optional to specify, e.g., DSCP.  There are likely to be various data nodes related to establishing appropriate security and encryption.

- an *encoding* to encode all YANG notification messages to the receiver, i.e., see {{Encodings}}.

- optional parameters to identify where traffic should egress the publisher:

  - a *source-interface*, identifying the egress interface to use from the publisher, implicitly choosing the source IP address and VRF.

  - a *source-vrf*, identifying the Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance on which to reach receivers.  This VRF is a network instance as defined in {{RFC8529}}.  Publisher support for VRFs is optional and advertised using the *supports-vrf* feature.

  - a *source-address* address, identifying the IP address to source notification messages from.

  If none of the above parameters are set, the publisher MAY choose which interface(s) and address(es) to source subscription notifications from.

This specification is transport independent, e.g., see {{transports}}, and thus the YANG module defined in {{yp-lite-yang-module}} cannot directly define and expose these transport parameters.  Instead, receiver-specific transport connectivity parameters MUST be configured via transport-specific augmentations to the YANG choice node */datastore-telemetry/receivers/receiver/transport-type*.

A publisher supporting configured subscriptions clearly must support at least one YANG data model that augments transport connectivity parameters onto */datastore-telemetry/receivers/receiver/transport-type*.  For an example of a similar such augmentation (but for YANG Push), see {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif}}. **TODO, this reference and text will need to be updated to a UDP-notif bis document, that augments the new YANG Push Lite receiver path.**

### Receivers for Dynamic Subscriptions {#DynamicSubscriptionReceivers}

For dynamic subscriptions, each subscription has a single receiver that is implicit from the host that initiated the *establish-subscription* RPC, reusing the same transport session for all the subscription notifications.

Hence most receiver parameters for a dynamic subscription, e.g., related to the transport, are implicitly determined and cannot be explicitly controlled.

Dynamic subscriptions MUST specify an encoding (see {{Encodings}}) and MAY specify DSCP Marking (see {{DSCP}}) for the telemetry notifications in the *establish-subscription* RPC (see {{EstablishSubscriptionYangTree}}).

### Receiver Session States and State Machine {#ReceiverStates}

Each subscription will need to establish a subscription to the specified receiver.  Multiple subscriptions may share one or more transport sessions to the same receiver.

A receiver in YANG Push Lite can be in one of the following states:

- **Configured**: The receiver has been configured on the publisher, but the receiver is not referenced by any valid subscriptions and hence there is no attempt to establish a connection to the receiver.

- **Connecting**: The receiver has at least one associated subscription and the publisher is attempting to establish a transport session and complete any required security exchanges, but this process has not yet succeeded.

- **Active**: The receiver has at least one associated subscription, a transport session has been established (if required), security exchanges have successfully completed, and the publisher is able to send notifications to the receiver.

The state transitions for a receiver are illustrated below:

                    |                   |
                    '-------------------'
~~~~
{: align="left" title="Receiver Session State Diagram" #ReceiverStateDiagram }

This state model allows implementations and operators to clearly distinguish between receivers that are simply configured, those that are in the process of connecting, and those that are actively being used.

If the configuration has changed such that there were previously connections to a receiver, but that receiver is no longer referenced by valid subscriptions, then the publisher MUST close any associated transport sessions to the receiver, but MAY delay the closing for a short period of time (no more than 15 minutes) to potentially allow existing transport session to be reused by new subscriptions.

## Transports {#transports}

This document describes a transport-agnostic mechanism for subscribing to YANG datastore telemetry.  Hence, separate specifications are required to define transports that support YANG Push Lite.  The requirements for these transport specifications are documented in the following section:

### Requirements for Yang Push Lite Transport Specifications

This section provides requirements for any transport specifications supporting the YANG Push Lite solution presented in this document.

The transport specification MUST provide YANG modules, to be implemented by publishers implementing the YANG Push configuration model in {{config-subs-data-model}}, that:

- augments the *datastore-telemetry/receivers/transport-type* choice statement with a container that both identifies the transport and contains all transport specific parameters.

- augments */sysc:system-capabilities/transport/transport-capabilities/* container with any transport specific capabilities or options (conditional on a YANG *when* statement).  Note, encodings for a given transport are advertised directly via the ietf-yp-lite-capabilities YANG Model {{yp-lite-yang-capabilities-module}}.

Using a secure transport is RECOMMENDED.  Thus, any transport specification MUST provide a mechanism to ensure secure communication between the publisher and receiver in a hostile environment, e.g., through the use of transport layer encryption.  Transport specifications MAY also specify a mechanism for unencrypted communications, which can be used when transport layer security is not required, e.g., if the transport session is being secured via another mechanism, or when operating within a controlled environment or test lab.

Any transport specification SHOULD support mutual receiver and publisher authentication at the transport layer.

The transport selected by the subscriber to reach the publisher SHOULD be able to support multiple "establish-subscription" requests made in the same transport session.

The transport specification MUST specifying how multiple subscriptions referencing the same receiver are to be handled at the transport layer.  The transport specification MAY require separate transport sessions per subscription to a given receiver, or it MAY allow multiple subscriptions to the same receiver to be multiplexed over a shared transport session.

A specification for a transport built upon this document can choose whether to use the same logical channel for the RPCs and the event records.  However, the *update* records and the subscription state change notifications MUST be sent on the same transport session.

The transport specification MAY specify a keepalive mechanism to keep the transport session alive.  There is no YANG Push Lite protocol or application level keepalive mechanism.

**TODO, do we need to mention anything about transport session timeouts, e.g., which would cause a subscription to be terminated.  What about buffering?  Is that a transport consideration?**

Additional transport requirements may be dictated by the choice of transport used with a subscription.

#### DSCP Marking {#DSCP}

YANG Push Lite supports *dscp* marking to differentiate prioritization of notification messages during network transit.

A receiver with a *dscp* leaf results in a corresponding Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking {{RFC2474}}} being placed in the IP header of any resulting *update* notification messages and subscription state change notifications.  A publisher MUST respect the DSCP markings for subscription traffic egressing that publisher.

The transport specification MUST specify if there are any particular quality-of-service or class-of-service considerations related to handling DSCP settings associated with the subscription.

## Encodings {#Encodings}

The *update* notification ({{EventRecords}}) and subscription lifecycle notifications ({{LifecycleNotifications}}) can be encoded in any format that has a definition for encoding YANG data.  For a given subscription, all notification messages are encoded using the same encoding.

Some IETF standards for YANG encodings known at the time of publication are:

- JSON, defined in {{RFC7951}}
- CBOR, defined in {{RFC9254}}, and {{RFC9595}} for using compressed schema identifiers (YANG SIDs)
- XML, defined in {{RFC7950}}

To maximize interoperability, all implementations are RECOMMENDED to support both JSON and CBOR encodings (using regular YANG identifiers).  Constrained platforms may not be able to support JSON and hence may choose to only support CBOR encoding.  JSON encoding may not be supported in the scenario that another encoding becomes the defacto standard (e.g., as JSON has largely replaced XML as the defacto choice for text based encoding).  Support for the XML encoding and/or CBOR encoding using YANG SIDs is OPTIONAL.

Encodings are defined in the *ietf-yp-lite.yang* as YANG identities that derive from the *encoding* base identity.  Additional encodings can be defined by defining and implementing new identities that derive from the *encoding* base identity, and also advertising those identities as part of the ietf-yp-lite-capabilities YANG module's transport capabilities {{yp-lite-yang-capabilities-module}}.

# Setting up and Managing Subscriptions {#ConfiguredAndDynamic}

Subscriptions can be set up and managed in two ways:

1. Configured Subscriptions - a subscription created and principally controlled by configuration.
2. Dynamic Subscriptions - a subscription created and principally controlled via YANG RPCs from a telemetry receiver.

Conformant implementations MUST implement at least one of the two mechanisms above for establishing and maintaining subscriptions, but they MAY choose to only implement a single mechanism.

The core behavior for both configured and dynamic subscription is the same, with the key differentiation being how they are provisioned, and how the transport is setup.  This next section describes the functionality that is common to both types of subscription, followed by the sections that describe the specifics and differences between the two ways of managing subscriptions.

## Common Subscription Parameters {#CommonSubscriptionParameters}

All subscriptions require the following state to be instantiated:

- a *name* to identify the subscription.
- the *target* for the subscription, comprising:
  - the target datastore, as per {{RFC8342}}
  - a set of selection filters to choose which datastore nodes the subscription is monitoring or sampling, as described in {{pathsAndFilters}}.
- the *update-trigger* to indicate when *update* notifications are generated:
  - *periodic*, for the publisher to send updated copies of the state on a periodic basis
  - *on-change*, for the publisher to send state updates when the internal state changes, i.e., event driven.
- receiver, transport, and encoding parameters, as per {{receivers}}.  How these are provided differs for configured vs dynamic subscriptions and is further explained in the sections below.

Subscription names MUST be unique across all configured and dynamic subscriptions.  Configured subscription take precedence over dynamic subscription, so:

- attempts to create a dynamic subscription with a name that conflicts with any other subscription (configured or dynamic) MUST fail,
- configuring a subscription, assuming it passes configuration validation, replaces any dynamic subscriptions with the same name.  Thus, causing the dynamic subscription to be immediately terminated (see {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}).
- **TODO: We want to make the name optional to be specified for dynamic subscriptions?  If not provided then the publisher could allocate using "dyn-\<XXX\>", where XXX is an increasing numeric subscription id?**

<!--
// This needs to be part of the management model part of the specification.

Both configured and dynamic subscriptions are represented in the list *datastore-telemetry/subscriptions/subscription*, and most of the functionality and behavior of configured and dynamic subscriptions described in this document is specified to be the same or very similar.  However, they differ in how they are created and in the associated lifecycle management, described in the following sections:

A publisher MAY terminate a dynamic subscription at any time. Similarly, it MAY decide to temporarily suspend the sending of notification messages for any dynamic subscription, or for one or more receivers of a configured subscription.  Such termination or suspension is driven by internal considerations of the publisher.
-->

### Subscription States

YANG Push Lite has a small set of simple states for a subscription on a publisher.  These states are intended to help clients easily determine the health and status of a subscription.

- **Invalid**: a subscription that is invalid for any reason.  E.g., the subscription references an invalid filter expression for the current device schema.  Normally, invalid configurations should be rejected by the system, whether due to subscription configuration or *establish-subscription* RPC, and hence this state should rarely be seen.

- **Inactive**: a valid subscription, but one that is not active because it has no associated receivers.  This state is unlikely to be seen for dynamic subscriptions.

- **Connecting**: a subscription that is valid, and has appropriate receiver configuration, but the publisher has not managed to successfully connect to any receivers yet, and hence has not sent a *subscription-started* notification.  Transport security failures would be in this state.  **TODO, what about no route to the receiver?**

- **Active**: a valid subscription, connected to all specified receivers, that has sent a *subscription-stated* notification and is generating *update* notifications, as per the terms of the subscription update policy.

- **Partial**: this is the same as per the description of *Active* above except that is has only managed to successfully connect to some receivers, not all of specified receivers associated with the subscription.

- **Terminated**: represents a subscription that has finished.  Subscriptions would only be expected to transiently be in this state and hence it would not normally be reported.  Terminated dynamic subscriptions, or unconfigured subscriptions, should quickly be removed from the operational state of the device.  Terminated

Below is a state diagram illustrating the states, and the likely changes between states.  However, this is not a formal state machine and publishers can move between arbitrary states based on changes to subscription properties, the system, connectivity to receivers, or resource constraints on the system.  New subscriptions should choose an appropriate starting state, e.g., either Inactive or Invalid.

{: title="Publisher's States for a Subscription"}
<!--
A subscription in the *valid* state may move to the *invalid* state in one of two ways.  First, it may be modified in a way that fails a re-evaluation.  See (2) in the diagram.  Second, the publisher might determine that the subscription is no longer supportable.  This could be because of an unexpected but sustained increase in an event stream's event records, degraded CPU capacity, a more complex referenced filter, or other subscriptions that have usurped resources.  See (3) in the diagram.  No matter the case, a *subscription-terminated* notification is sent to any receivers in the *active* or state.  Finally, a subscription may be deleted by configuration (4).

When a subscription is in the *valid* state, a publisher will attempt to connect with all receivers of a configured subscription and deliver notification messages.  Below is the state machine for each receiver of a configured subscription.  This receiver state machine is fully contained in the state machine of the configured subscription and is only relevant when the configured subscription is in the *valid* state.

When a configured subscription first moves to the *valid* state, the *state* leaf of each receiver is initialized to the *connecting* state.  If transport connectivity is not available to any receivers and there are any notification messages to deliver, a transport session is established (e.g., per {{RFC8071}}).  Individual receivers are moved to the *active* state when a *subscription-started* subscription state change notification is successfully passed to that receiver (a).  Event records are only sent to active receivers. Receivers of a configured subscription remain active on the publisher if both (1) transport connectivity to the receiver is active and (2) event records are not being dropped due to a publisher's sending capacity being reached.  In addition, a configured subscription's receiver MUST be moved to the "connecting" state if the receiver is reset via the "reset" action (b), (c).  For more on the "reset" action, see Section 2.5.5.  If transport connectivity cannot be achieved while in the "connecting" state, the receiver MAY be moved to the "disconnected" state.

A configured subscription's receiver MUST be moved to the "suspended" state if there is transport connectivity between the publisher and receiver but (1) delivery of notification messages is failing due to a publisher's buffer capacity being reached or (2) notification messages cannot be generated for that receiver due to insufficient CPU (d).  This is indicated to the receiver by the "subscription-suspended" subscription state change notification.

A configured subscription's receiver MUST be returned to the "active" state from the "suspended" state when notification messages can be generated, bandwidth is sufficient to handle the notification messages, and a receiver has successfully been sent a "subscription-resumed" or "subscription-modified" subscription state change notification (e).  The choice as to which of these two subscription state change notifications is sent is determined by whether the subscription was modified during the period of suspension.

Modification of a configured subscription is possible at any time.  A "subscription-modified" subscription state change notification will be sent to all active receivers, immediately followed by notification messages conforming to the new parameters.  Suspended receivers will
also be informed of the modification.  However, this notification will await the end of the suspension for that receiver (e).
-->

### Creating Subscriptions {#CreatingSubscriptions}

After a subscription is successfully established, the publisher immediately sends a *subscription-started* subscription state change notification to each receiver.  It is quite possible that upon configuration, reboot, or even steady-state operations, a transport session may not be currently available to the receiver.  In this case, when there is something to transport for an active subscription, transport-specific "call home" operations {{RFC8071}} will be used to establish the connection. **TODO - this should just reference the transport RFCs**.  When transport connectivity is available, notification messages may then be pushed.

With active configured subscriptions, it is allowable to buffer event records even after a *subscription-started* has been sent.  However, if events are lost (rather than just delayed) due to buffer capacity being reached, a *subscription-terminated* notification MUST be sent, followed by a new *subscription-started* notification. These notifications indicate an event record discontinuity has occurred.

### Modifying Subscriptions {#ModifyingSubscriptions}

Subscriptions MAY be modified in various ways:

1. the subscription *filter* (inline, referring to a different named filter, or changing the referenced filter), *update-triggers*, or *description* may be changed.
1. *receivers* may be added or removed.
1. parameter associated with a receiver may be changed.

The following sections describe how these changes are handled.

#### Changing configuration associated with the subscription {#ChangingSubscriptionConfiguration}

If any of the following properties associated with a subscription are changed:

- the content of an inline filter,
- the name, or content, of a referenced filter,
- the *encoding*,
- the *update-triggers*,
- the *description* field,
- the YANG schema used by subscription,
- any other fields that are included in a *subscription-started* notification message

then the subscription must be terminated, as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}, and then recreated, as per {{CreatingSubscriptions}}.  This can be used to trigger any necessary actions on the receiver to ensure that it can successfully process any changes to the subscription *update* notifications.

If the publisher believes that the schema associated with a subscription may have changed then it may defensively terminate and recreate the subscription.

#### Adding receivers {#AddingReceivers}

If the modification involves adding one or more receivers, then once the transport session to the new receiver(s) has been established, i.e., they have reached the *receiver active* state ({{ReceiverStates}}), then a new *subscription-started* notification ({{SubscriptionStartedNotification}}) MUST be sent on the subscription to **all receivers**.

#### Removing receivers {#RemovingReceivers}

If all receivers, or the last active receiver, is removed then the subscription becomes *inactive* and a *subscription-terminated* notification SHOULD be sent to all receivers, if possible, prior to bringing down any session to the receivers.  Obviously, if the transport session to the receiver has closed then it will not be possible to send a *subscription-terminated* notification to that receiver.

If one or more receivers are removed, but at least one receiver for the subscription remains active, then a *receiver-disconnected* notification is sent *only* to the receivers that has been removed from the subscription.  Any receivers that are still active don't receiver any notification.

#### Changing receiver configuration

If the settings associated with a receiver are changed, then the publisher has two choices:

1. It MAY treat the change as a removal of the receiver ({{RemovingReceivers}}), followed by the addition of a receiver ({{AddingReceivers}}).

1. If it is a minor configuration change, e.g., a change to the DSCP settings, then it MAY dynamically update the transport session behavior without notifying the receiver.

**TODO, should we add changing the source address/port as an example here?  Or it is just simpler to just always force the receiver to be removed and re-added for simplicity?  Is further prose required about what is allowed to be handled in this fashion?**

### Terminating Subscriptions {#TerminatingSubscriptions}

Subscriptions MUST be terminated by the publisher due to any of the following circumstances:

1. The subscription has been unconfigured.
1. Some subscription, receiver, transport or encoding configuration has been removed, e.g., receiver configuration, such that there is no longer the sufficient minimum information to maintain the subscription.
1. A dynamic subscription has been terminated via a *delete-subscription* or *kill-subscription* YANG RPC.
1. Transport connectivity to all receivers have been lost, either due to network issues, or a failure in the security session state.
1. The publisher doesn't have sufficient resources to honor the terms of the subscription, i.e., it is generating too many *update* notifications, or attempting to send too much data.
1. The subscription parameters have changed in such a way, i.e., as defined in {{ChangingSubscriptionConfiguration}}, that means the subscription needs to be reset by terminating and recreating it.
1. The *reset* RPC is invoked on a configured subscription, or on the referenced receiver associated with a configured subscription.

In addition, from a receiver's perspective, if transport connectivity is lost, then that is equivalent to terminating the subscription via a *subscription-terminated* notification.

If possible, the publisher MUST try and close the subscription gracefully by generating a *subscription-terminated* notification to all receivers before closing any sessions to any receivers that have no remaining subscriptions.  Publishers MAY complete their current collection if one is in progress before generating the *subscription-terminated* notification.  Obviously, if transport connectivity to a receiver has been lost then neither of these two actions will be possible.

The publisher MUST NOT generate any further events, e.g., *update* notifications, related to the subscription after the *subscription-terminated* notification has been generated.  In addition, receivers SHOULD ignore any messages received outside of an active subscription, i.e., either before a *subscription-started* notification or after a *subscription-terminated* or *receiver-disconnected* notification.

If the publisher accepts the request, which it MUST, if the subscription-id matches a dynamic subscription established in the same transport session, then it should stop the subscription and send a *subscription-terminated* notification.


## Subscription Lifecycle Notifications {#LifecycleNotifications}

In addition to sending event records to receivers, a publisher also sends subscription lifecycle state change notifications when lifecycle events related to subscription management occur.

Subscription state change notifications are generated per subscription, and are injected into the steam of *update* messages for that that subscription.  These notifications MUST NOT be dropped or filtered.

Future extensions, or implementations MAY augment additional fields into the notification structures.  Receivers MUST silently ignore unexpected fields.

The complete set of subscription state change notifications is described in the following subsections:

### "subscription-started" {#SubscriptionStartedNotification}

The subscription started notification is sent to a receiver to indicate that a subscription is active and they may start to receive *update* records from the publisher.

The subscription started notification may be sent for any of these reasons:

1. A new subscription (configured or dynamic) has been started.

1. A receiver has been added to a subscription.

1. The properties of a subscription has been changed, in which case a *subscription-terminated* notification should be sent, followed by a *subscription-started* notification if the new properties are valid.

1. A configured subscription previously failed, and was terminated.  After the publisher has successfully re-established a connection to the receiver and is read to send datastore event records again.


Below is the tree diagram for the *subscription-started* notification.  All data nodes contained in this tree diagram are described in the YANG module in {{yp-lite-yang-module}}.

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/subscription-started.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="subscription-started Notification Tree Diagram"}

### "subscription-terminated" {#SubscriptionTerminatedNotification}

For a receiver, this notification indicates that no further event records for an active subscription should be expected from the publisher unless and until a new *subscription-started* notification is received.

A *subscription-terminated* notification SHOULD only be sent by a publisher to a receiver if a *subscription-started* notification was previously sent.

The subscription terminated notification may be sent to a receiver for any of these reasons:

1. A receiver has been removed from a configured subscription.

1. A subscription has been stopped, either due to the change/removal of some configuration, or an RPC has been used to delete or kill a subscription.

1. The properties of a subscription has been changed, in which case a *subscription-terminated* notification should be sent, followed by a *subscription-started* notification if the new properties are valid.

1. A subscription has failed for any reason, e.g.,:

    - The publisher is no longer able to honor the subscription, due to resource constraints, or the filter is no longer valid.

    - Any transport level buffer to the receiver has become full, and the hence the publisher is dropping *update* notifications.

Below is a tree diagram for "subscription-terminated".  All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in {{yp-lite-yang-module}}.

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/subscription-terminated.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="subscription-terminated Notification Tree Diagram"}

**TODO Augmenting extra fields is better for clients?**  The *reason* data node identityref indicates why a subscription has been terminated, and could be extended with further reasons in future.  I suggest that we change this to an enum with an optional description field.**

### "receiver-disconnected" {#ReceiverDisconnectedNotification}

Configured subscriptions support multiple receivers.  If one particular receiver is slow to process notifications, e.g., causing

The *receiver-disconnected* notification is sent to a specific receiver if the publisher has a multi-receiver subscription, and the publisher has decided to stop sending notification to a particular receiver, but the subscription will continue sending updates to other receivers.  Note the *subscription-terminated* notification is a publisher is stopping sending messages to all receivers.

Possible reasons as to why a publisher may disconnect a receiver are:

- the receiver is too slow processing the messages causing the subscription to back pressure overflowing internal buffers,
- the transport session is unreliable, frequently dropping and reconnecting.


~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/update-complete.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="update-complete Notification Tree Diagram"}


### "update-completed"

**TODO, this description needs to be updated**.

This notification indicates that all of the event records prior to the current time have been passed to a receiver.  It is sent before any notification messages containing an event record with a timestamp later than (1) the subscription's start time.

After the *update-complete* notification has been sent, additional event records will be sent in sequence as they arise naturally on the publisher.

Below is a tree diagram for *update-complete*.  All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in Section 4.

{::include generated-tree-output/update-complete.txt}
~~~~
{: align="left" title="update-complete Notification Tree Diagram"}


## Configured Subscriptions {#configured-subscriptions}

Configured subscriptions allow the management of subscriptions via configuration so that a publisher can send notification messages to a receiver.

This document specifies the ietf-yp-lite-config YANG module {{yp-lite-config-yang-module}} that defines an configuration model for configuring subscriptions.  Support for this YANG module is OPTIONAL and is advertised using the normal YANG mechanisms, e.g., {{RFC8525}}. **TODO, do we also advertise support via capabilities, i.e., [issue 16](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/16)**

In addition to the common subscription parameters described in {{CommonSubscriptionParameters}}, a configured subscription also includes:

- one or more associated receivers for the subscription, as described in {{receivers}}.  The references receivers specify all transport, receiver, and encoding parameters.

Configured subscriptions have several characteristics distinguishing them from dynamic subscriptions, such as:

- configured subscriptions are created, modified or deleted, by any configuration client with write permission on the subscription configuration.

- configured subscriptions have the ability to send notification messages to more than one receiver.  All receivers for a given subscription MUST use the same encoding.

- The lifetime of a configured subscription is tied to the configuration.  I.e., if a valid and complete configuration exists for a subscription, then the publisher MUST attempt to connect to the receiver and honor the requirements of the subscription.  In particular:

  - If the configuration is altered or removed then the subscription will similarly be altered or removed.

  - If the device reboots, then the configured subscription will obviously end, but once the subscription configuration has been processed after boot up, then the subscription will be recreated again, assuming the subscription configuration is still valid.

  - If transport connectivity to the receiver is broken, then any subscriptions using that transport are terminated, but the publisher MUST periodically attempt to re-establish connection to the receiver and re-activate any configured subscriptions to that receiver.

  - Note, if there are no active subscriptions for a given receiver then any transport session(s) associated with that receiver MUST be closed, but that MAY be after a short delay.

- Other than the *reset* YANG Action, described in {{reset}}, there are no YANG RPCs to dynamically create, modify, or delete a configured subscription, any alterations MUST be done via changes to the configuration.

### Creating a Configured Subscription

Configured subscriptions are those created via changes to the publisher's configuration, e.g., using the YANG module defined in {{config-subs-data-model}}, or an equivalent configuration mechanism, such as a command-line interface, or alternative YANG configuration model.

After the configuration change has been accepted by the system, then the subscription is updated, as per {{CreatingSubscriptions}}.

**TODO, to see an example of subscription creation using configuration operations over NETCONF, see Appendix A.**

### Modifying a Configured Subscription

Configured subscriptions can be modified due to configuration changes in the subscription configuration or referenced configuration, i.e., filters or receivers.  After the configuration change has been accepted by the system, then the subscription is updated, as per {{ModifyingSubscriptions}}.

### Deleting a Configured Subscription

Configured subscriptions can be deleted via configuration.  After the configuration change has been accepted by the system the subscription is terminated, as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}.

### Resetting a Configured Subscription {#reset}

Configured subscriptions are generally expected to self-monitor and automatically reconnect to the receivers if they experience network or transport issues.  However, the data model also defines explicit YANG *actions* to either: (i) reset a single subscription, or (ii) reset all subscriptions and the transports(s) associated with a specific configured receiver instance.

These reset actions primarily act at the subscription application layer, but may be useful if a receiver or collector determines that a configured subscription is not behaving correctly, and wishes to force a reset of the subscription without modifying the configuration associated with the subscription or forcing a configuration change on the publisher device.

The reset action on a subscription is handled equivalently to removing and re-adding the subscription configuration.  I.e., the subscription MUST be terminated, as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}} before being recreated, as per {{CreatingSubscriptions}}.  The reset action also resets (terminated and re-establishes) any subscription specific transport session that is not shared with any other subscriptions.

The reset action on a receiver is handled equivalently to removing and re-adding the receiver configuration for the receiver that has been reset.  Specifically, every subscription referencing the receiver MUST be terminated, as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}} before being recreated, as per {{CreatingSubscriptions}}.  Any transport sessions tied to the subscriptions referencing the reset receiver MUST also be terminated and re-established.

## Dynamic Subscriptions {#DynamicSubscriptions}

Dynamic subscriptions are where a subscriber initiates a subscription negotiation with a publisher via a YANG RPC {{RFC7950}}.

Support for dynamic subscriptions is OPTIONAL, with its availability advertised via the *dynamic* YANG feature in the ietf-yp-lite YANG module {{yp-lite-yang-module}}, and also via the capabilities module {{yp-lite-yang-capabilities-module}}.

Dynamic subscription differ from configured subscription in the following ways:

- Dynamic subscription reuse the same transport session on which the *establish-subscription* RPC was received to send back any notifications, and so the transport and receiver do not need to be specified and each dynamic subscription can always only have a single receiver.

- The publisher MUST reply to the *establish-subscription* RPC before sending the *subscription-started* or any *update* notifications for this subscription.

- The lifetime of a dynamic subscription is bound by the transport session used to establish it.  If the transport session fails then the dynamic subscription MUST be terminated.

- Active dynamic subscriptions cannot be modified on the fly, instead, the client is required to send a *delete-subscription* YANG RPC followed by a *establish-subscription* YANG RPC.

- Dynamic subscriptions can either be terminated by the client that established the subscription sending a *delete-subscription* YANG RPC on the same transport session, or any client with sufficient access permissions invoking the *kill-subscription* YANG RPC.

- A publisher MAY terminate a dynamic subscription at any time, i.e., due to internal constraints of the publisher.

- If a dynamic subscription is terminated for any reason, then the client is responsible for re-establishing the subscription if it is still required.

- If the publisher cannot honor the terms of a dynamic subscription then the subscription MUST be terminated. **TODO, is this a SHOULD or MUST, do we want some leeway for temporary issues? E.g., allow some buffering. Also, this effectively applies to config subscriptions as well and hence should move.**

<!--

### Dynamic Subscription State Machine

Below is the publisher's state machine for a dynamic subscription. Each state is shown in its own box.  It is important to note that such a subscription doesn't exist at the publisher until an *establish-subscription* RPC is accepted.  The mere request by a subscriber to establish a subscription is not sufficient for that subscription to be externally visible.  Start and end states are depicted to reflect subscription creation and deletion events.

~~~~
                  .........
                  : start :

                 | receiver  |
                 |  active   |
                 |           |
                 '- - - - - - - - - - -'
                      |
            delete/kill-subscription
                      |
                      v
                  .........
                  :  end  :
                  :.......:
~~~~
{: title="Publisher's State Machine for a Dynamic Subscription"}

Of interest in this state machine are the following:

- Successful "establish-subscription" RPCs move the subscription to the "active" state.

- A "delete-subscription" or "kill-subscription" RPC will end the subscription.

- A publisher may choose to end a subscription when there is not sufficient CPU or bandwidth available to service the subscription.  This is announced to the subscriber via the *subscription-terminated* subscription state change notification.  The receiver will need to establish a new subscription.

-->

### Establishing a Dynamic Subscription {#EstablishDynamic}

The *establish-subscription* RPC allows a subscriber to request the creation of a subscription.

In addition to the common subscription parameters described in {{CommonSubscriptionParameters}}, the *establish-subscription* YANG RPC:

- includes the *encoding* to be used for all YANG push lite notifications

- optionally includes DSCP settings to use for the transport.

- a dynamic subscription may reference a configured target *filter*.  If the configuration for the referenced filter changes then the subscription MUST be terminated {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}.

The DSCP code point settings for all subscription using the same transport session MUST be the same.  Attempts to invoke *establish-subscription* with a different DSCP code point MUST be rejected.

If the publisher can satisfy the *establish-subscription* request, it replies with a numeric identifier for the subscription and then immediately starts streaming notification messages.

A dynamic subscription request MUST be declined if a publisher determines that it may be unable to provide update records meeting the terms of an *establish-subscription* RPC request.

Below is a tree diagram for *establish-subscription* YANG RPC.  All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in {{yp-lite-yang-module}}.

### Deleting a Dynamic Subscription

The *delete-subscription* operation permits canceling an existing dynamic subscription that was established on the same transport session connecting to the subscriber.

The publisher responds to the request in the following way:

- If the name identifier matches a *dynamic* subscription created on the same transport session then it MUST terminate the subscription, as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}.

  The publisher MAY reply back to the client before the subscription has been terminated, i.e., it may act asynchronously with respect to the delete request, however, the publisher MUST allow the client to create a new subscription using the same name immediately after either the RPC operation completes or the *subscription-terminated* notification ({{SubscriptionTerminatedNotification}}) has been transmitted.

- Otherwise, the request is failed with an "unknown subscription" error message.

Below is the tree diagram for the *delete-subscription* RPC.  All objects contained in this tree are described in the YANG module in {{yp-lite-yang-module}}.

~~~~ yangtree
{::include generated-tree-output/delete-subscription.txt}
~~~~
{: title="delete-subscription YANG RPC" #DeleteSubscriptionYangTree }

### Killing a Dynamic Subscription

The *kill-subscription* RPC operation permits a client, that has the required access permissions, to forcibly terminate any arbitrary dynamic subscription, identified by subscription name, including those not associated with the transport session used for the *kill-subscription* RPC.  The subscription is terminated as per {{TerminatingSubscriptions}}.

The publisher MAY reply back to the client before the subscription has been terminated, i.e., it may act asynchronously with respect to the delete request, however, the publisher MUST allow the client to create a new subscription using the same name immediately after the *subscription-terminated* notification ({{SubscriptionTerminatedNotification}}) has been transmitted.

~~~~
{: title="kill-subscription YANG RPC" #KillSubscriptionYangTree }

### RPC Failures

**TODO, we should see if we can simplify how errors are reported.**

Whenever an RPC is unsuccessful, the publisher returns relevant
information as part of the RPC error response.  Transport-level error
processing MUST be done before the RPC error processing described in
this section.  In all cases, RPC error information returned by the
publisher will use existing transport-layer RPC structures, such as
those seen with NETCONF (Appendix A of [RFC6241]) or RESTCONF
(Section 7.1 of [RFC8040]).  These structures MUST be able to encode
subscription-specific errors identified below and defined in this
document's YANG data model.

As a result of this variety, how subscription errors are encoded in
an RPC error response is transport dependent.  Valid errors that can
occur for each RPC are as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~
  establish-subscription         modify-subscription
  ----------------------         ----------------------
  dscp-unavailable               filter-unsupported
  encoding-unsupported           insufficient-resources
  filter-unsupported             no-such-subscription
  insufficient-resources

  delete-subscription            kill-subscription
  ----------------------         ----------------------
  no-such-subscription           no-such-subscription
~~~~~~~~~~

To see a NETCONF-based example of an error response from the list
above, see the "no-such-subscription" error response illustrated in
{{RFC8640}}, Figure 10.

There is one final set of transport-independent RPC error elements
included in the YANG data model defined in this document: three
yang-data structures that enable the publisher to provide to the
receiver any error information that does not fit into existing
transport-layer RPC structures.  These structures are:

1. "establish-subscription-stream-error-info": This MUST be returned
    with the leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not
    been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
    "establish-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent if
    hints on how to overcome the RPC error are included.

2. "modify-subscription-stream-error-info": This MUST be returned
    with the leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not
    been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
    "modify-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent if hints
    on how to overcome the RPC error are included.

3. "delete-subscription-error-info": This MUST be returned with the
    leaf "reason" populated if an RPC error reason has not been
    placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
    "delete-subscription" or "kill-subscription" RPC response.


# Robustness, Reliability, and Subscription Monitoring

## Robustness and Reliability

It is important for clients to have confidence that the telemetry data that they receive is correct and complete.  The design of YANG Push Lite achieves this in several ways:

- the *complete* flag in *update* notification, or the equivalent *update-complete* notification, are used to signal when all data for a periodic collection event has been enqueued.  This allows clients to delete stale information and monitor the performance and behavior of the publisher.

- publishers use buffers when enqueuing traffic on to a transport to a receiver, but if that buffer becomes full then either the subscription is terminated, or in the case of a configured subscription with multiple receivers the slow receiver is disconnected from the subscription.  In the case of dynamic subscriptions, the client may attempt to re-created the subscription.  For configured subscriptions, the publisher should attempt to periodically recreate the subscription or reconnect the receiver.

  - **TODO, do we want to allow for a more lossy mode where the publisher just tail drops if the buffer is full?  If we do, then this looks like it should be a configurable option.**

  - **TODO, ensure that we document how to reconnect to an new receiver**

- the *notification envelope* structure, {{FullNotificationExample}}, used for all YANG Push notifications contains a monotonically increasing *sequence-number* field that allows for lost messages in an end-to-end data pipeline spanning multiple transport hops to be detected, allowing appropriate mitigation steps to be taken.  For example, see figure 1 in {{I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture}}.

  - **TODO, sequence-numbers are unique except for the receiver-disconnected message.**

- the protocol relies on transport protocols that are either reliable, e.g., TCP or HTTP, or unreliable transports that employ mechanisms for clients to detect when losses at the transport layer have occurred, e.g., the *message id* in {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-udp-notif}} (**TODO fix reference to bis version, once that becomes available**).

- finally, if a publisher is not able to honor the expectation for a subscription for any reason, then the publisher always has the option to terminate the subscription.  It can then subsequently refuse to handle new subscriptions if it does not have sufficient resources to handle the subscription.

<!-- TODO, I think that this text is superfluous to requirements, but we will keep it around a bit longer in case it is needed.

A subscription to updates from a datastore is intended to obviate the need for polling.  However, in order to do so, it is critical that subscribers can rely on the subscription and have confidence that they will indeed receive the subscribed updates without having to worry about updates being silently dropped.  In other words, a subscription constitutes a promise on the side of the publisher to provide the receivers with updates per the terms of the subscription, or otherwise notify the receiver if t

Now, there are many reasons why a publisher may at some point no longer be able to fulfill the terms of the subscription, even if the subscription had been initiated in good faith.  For example, the volume of datastore nodes may be larger than anticipated, the interval may prove too short to send full updates in rapid succession, or an internal problem may prevent objects from being collected.  For this reason, the solution defined in this document (1) mandates that a publisher notify receivers immediately and reliably whenever it encounters a situation in which it is unable to keep the terms of the subscription and (2) provides the publisher with the option to suspend the subscription in such a case.  This includes indicating the fact that an update is incomplete as part of a "push-update" or "push-change-update" notification, as well as emitting a "subscription-suspended" notification as applicable.  This is described further in Section 3.11.1.

A publisher SHOULD reject a request for a subscription if it is unlikely that the publisher will be able to fulfill the terms of that subscription request.  In such cases, it is preferable to have a subscriber request a less resource-intensive subscription than to deal with frequently degraded behavior.

The solution builds on [RFC8639].  As defined therein, any loss of an underlying transport connection will be detected and result in subscription termination (in the case of dynamic subscriptions) or suspension (in the case of configured subscriptions), ensuring that situations where the loss of update notifications would go unnoticed will not occur.
-->

## Subscription Monitoring

In the operational state datastore, the *datastore-telemetry* container maintains operational state for all configured and dynamic subscriptions.

Dynamic subscriptions are only present in the *datastore-telemetry/subscriptions/subscription* list when they are active, and are removed as soon as they are terminated.  Whereas configured subscriptions are present if the list if they are configured, regardless of whether they are active.

**TODO, should dynamic receivers be listed?  Do we need to report per-receiver stats for dynamic subscriptions?**

The operational state is important for monitoring the health of subscriptions, receivers, and the overall telemetry subsystem.

This includes:

**TODO, update the YANG model with more useful operational data, and mostly this section should briefly summarize and refer to the YANG model.  We should also consider what indications to include from filters that cause a larger amount of internal work but don't generate a large number of transmitted notifications.**

- per subscription status and counters

- per receiver status and counters

- maybe some indication of the overall load on the telemetry subsystem, but we need to consider how useful that actually is, and whether just monitoring the device CPU load and general performance would be a better indication.

<!-- TODO - Consider incorporating some aspects of this text.
Each subscription in the operational state datastore is represented as a list element.  Included in this list are event counters for each receiver, the state of each receiver, and the subscription parameters currently in effect.  The appearance of the leaf "configured-subscription-state" indicates that a particular subscription came into being via configuration.  This leaf also indicates whether the current state of that subscription is "valid", "invalid", or "concluded".

To understand the flow of event records in a subscription, there are two counters available for each receiver.  The first counter is "sent-event-records", which shows the number of events identified for sending to a receiver.  The second counter is "excluded-event-records", which shows the number of event records not sent to a receiver.  "excluded-event-records" shows the combined results of both access control and per-subscription filtering.  For configured subscriptions, counters are reset whenever the subscription's state is evaluated as "valid" (see (1) in Figure 8).

// Taken from another section.
In addition, the YANG Push Lite operational data gives an indication of the overall telemetry load on the device and hence gives an indication to whether a particular telemetry request is likely to be accepted, and honored.
-->


## Publisher Capacity

It is far preferable to decline a subscription request than to accept such a request when it cannot be met.

Whether or not a subscription can be supported will be determined by a combination of several factors, such as the subscription update trigger (on-change or periodic), the period in which to report changes (one-second periods will consume more resources than one-hour periods), the amount of data in the datastore subtree that is being subscribed to, the number and combination of other subscriptions that are concurrently being serviced, and the overall load from other services running on the publisher.

# Conformance and Capabilities {#ConformanceAndCapabilities}

The normative text in this document already indicates which parts of the specification must or should be implemented for a compliant YANG Push Lite implementation via the use of {{RFC2119}} language.  It also sets out some additional related requirements, e.g., on transports {{transports}}, that add in additional functionality.

Some parts of this specification are optional to implement.  Some of these optional parts can be identified through the use of YANG Library {{RFC8525}} specifying the list of implemented YANG modules and YANG features.  But, the broader approach adopted by this specification is via extending the ietf-system-capabilities YANG module specified in {{RFC9196}} to make capability information available as standard YANG described operational data.

## Capabilities

Publishers SHOULD implement the ietf-system-capabilities YANG module, defined in {{RFC9196}}, and the ietf-yp-lite-capabilities YANG module, defined in {{yp-lite-yang-capabilities-module}}) that augments ietf-system-capabilities.

The ietf-yp-lite-capabilities module contains capabilities to indicate what types of subscriptions and transports may be configured, along with acceptable subscription parameter for given subtrees.

The schema tree for the ietf-system-capabilities augmented by ietf-yp-lite-capabilities is given below.

**TODO, do we need additional capabilities, as per [Issue 18](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/18)**

## Subscription Content Schema Identification

YANG Module Synchronization

To make subscription requests, the subscriber needs to know the YANG datastore schemas used by the publisher.  These schemas are available in the YANG library module ietf-yang-library.yang as defined in {{RFC8525}}.  The receiver is expected to know the YANG library information before starting a subscription.

The set of modules, revisions, features, and deviations can change at runtime (if supported by the publisher implementation).  For this purpose, the YANG library provides a simple "yang-library-change" notification that informs the subscriber that the library has changed.  In this case, a subscription may need to be updated to take the updates into account.  The receiver may also need to be informed of module changes in order to process updates regarding datastore

**TODO, this section should be updated so that a subscription is restarted if the schema that it is using changes, and to incorporate ideas to fingerprint the subscription schema in the subscription-started notification.**

# Security Considerations {#security}

With configured subscriptions, one or more publishers could be used to overwhelm a receiver.  To counter this, notification messages SHOULD NOT be sent to any receiver that does not support this specification.  Receivers that do not want notification messages need only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from the publisher.

When a receiver of a configured subscription gets a new "subscription-started" message for a known subscription where it is already consuming events, it may indicate that an attacker has done something that has momentarily disrupted receiver connectivity. **TODO - Do we still want this paragraph?**.

For dynamic subscriptions, implementations need to protect against malicious or buggy subscribers that may send a large number of "establish-subscription" requests and thereby use up system resources.  To cover this possibility, operators SHOULD monitor for such cases and, if discovered, take remedial action to limit the resources used, such as suspending or terminating a subset of the subscriptions or, if the underlying transport is session based, terminating the underlying transport session.

Using DNS names for configured subscription's receiver "name" lookups can cause situations where the name resolves differently than expected on the publisher, so the recipient would be different than expected.

## Use of YANG Push Lite with NACM

**TODO, do we even need this section?**

This specification MAY be used with access control tools, such as NACM {{RFC8341}}.  Please refer to that specification for normative guidance of how NACM applies.

For informative purposes, please note that NACM can be used:

- NACM can be used to control access to the data nodes and RPCs defined in the YANG modules defined in this document.
- NACM can be used to control access to the data included in the YANG *update* notifications.

## Receiver Authorization

**TODO Relax when access control must be checked.**

**TODO Consider if this is the best place in the document, but this text needs to be updated regardless.**

A receiver of subscription data MUST only be sent updates for which it has proper authorization.  A publisher MUST ensure that no unauthorized data is included in push updates.  To do so, it needs to apply all corresponding checks applicable at the time of a specific pushed update and, if necessary, silently remove any unauthorized data from datastore subtrees.  This enables YANG data that is pushed based on subscriptions to be authorized in a way that is equivalent to a regular data retrieval ("get") operation.

Each "push-update" and "push-change-update" MUST have access control applied, as depicted in Figure 5.  This includes validating that read access is permitted for any new objects selected since the last notification message was sent to a particular receiver.  A publisher MUST silently omit data nodes from the results that the client is not authorized to see.  To accomplish this, implementations SHOULD apply the conceptual authorization model of {{RFC8341}}, specifically Section 3.2.4, extended to apply analogously to data nodes included in notifications, not just \<rpc-reply\> messages sent in response to
\<get\> and \<get-config\> requests.

~~~~~~~~~~
                     +-----------------+      +--------------------+
  push-update or --> | datastore node  |  yes | add datastore node |
 push-change-update  | access allowed? | ---> | to update record   |
                     +-----------------+      +--------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~
{: align="left" title="Access Control for Push Updates"}


A publisher MUST allow for the possibility that a subscription's selection filter references nonexistent data or data that a receiver is not allowed to access.  Such support permits a receiver the ability to monitor the entire lifecycle of some datastore tree without needing to explicitly enumerate every individual datastore node.  If, after access control has been applied, there are no objects remaining in an update record, then the effect varies given if the subscription is a periodic or on-change subscription.  For a periodic subscription, an empty "push-update" notification MUST be sent, so that clients do not get confused into thinking that an update was lost.  For an on-change subscription, a "push-update" notification MUST NOT be sent, so that clients remain unaware of changes made to nodes they don't have read-access for.

A publisher MAY choose to reject an "establish-subscription" request that selects nonexistent data or data that a receiver is not allowed to access.  The error identity "unchanging-selection" SHOULD be returned as the reason for the rejection.  In addition, a publisher MAY choose to terminate a dynamic subscription or suspend a configured receiver when the authorization privileges of a receiver change or the access controls for subscribed objects change.  In that case, the publisher SHOULD include the error identity "unchanging-selection" as the reason when sending the "subscription-terminated" or "subscription-suspended" notification, respectively.  Such a capability enables the publisher to avoid having to support
continuous and total filtering of a subscription's content for every update record.  It also reduces the possibility of leakage of access-controlled objects.

If read access into previously accessible nodes has been lost due to a receiver permissions change, this SHOULD be reported as a patch "delete" operation for on-change subscriptions.  If not capable of handling such receiver permission changes with such a "delete", publisher implementations MUST force dynamic subscription re-establishment or configured subscription reinitialization so that appropriate filtering is installed.

## YANG Module Security Considerations

This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7.1 of {{I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}}.

The "ietf-yp-lite" YANG module defines a data model that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as NETCONF {{RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{RFC8040}}. These protocols have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH {{RFC4252}}, TLS {{RFC8446}}, and QUIC {{RFC9000}}) and have to use mutual authentication.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{RFC8341}} provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

- There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes.

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes. Specifically, the following subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

- There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes.

Some of the RPC or action operations in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control access to these operations. Specifically, the following operations have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

- kill-subscription - this RPC operation allows the caller to kill any dynamic subscription, even those created via other users, or other transport sessions.

# Functional changes between YANG Push Lite and YANG Push {#DifferencesFromYangPush}

This non-normative section highlights the significant functional changes where the YANG Push Lite implementation differs from YANG Push.  However, the main body of this document, from {{overview}} onwards, provides the normative definition of the YANG Push Lite specification, except for any text or sections that explicitly indicate that they are informative rather being normative.

*Note to reviewers: If you notice mistakes in this section during development of the document and solution then please point them out to the authors and the working group.* **(RFC editor, please remove this paragraph prior to publication)**

## Removed Functionality

This section lists functionality specified in {{RFC8639}} and YANG Push which is not specified in YANG Push Lite.

- Negotiation and hints of failed subscriptions.

- The RPC to modify an existing dynamic subscription, instead the subscription must be terminated and re-established.

- The ability to suspend and resume a dynamic subscription.  Instead a dynamic subscription is terminated if the device cannot reliably fulfill the subscription or a receiver is too slow causing the subscription to be back pressured.

- Specifying a subscription stop time, and the corresponding subscription-completed notification have been removed.

- Replaying of buffered event records are not supported.  The nearest equivalent is requesting a sync-on-start replay when the subscription transport session comes up which will reply the current state.

- QoS weighting and dependency between subscriptions has been removed due to the complexity of implementation.

- Support for reporting subscription error hints has been removed.  The device SHOULD reject subscriptions that are likely to overload the device, but more onus is placed on the operator configuring the subscriptions or setting up the dynamic subscriptions to ensure that subscriptions are reasonable, as they would be expected to do for any other configuration.

- The "subscription-state-notif" extension has been removed.

- The YANG Patch format {{RFC8072}} is no longer used for on-change subscriptions.

- Configured subscriptions with multiple receivers must use the same encoding for all receivers.

## Changed Functionality

This section documents behavior that exists in both YANG Push and YANG Push Lite, but the behavior differs between the two:

- All YANG Push Lite notifications messages use {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-notif-envelope}} rather than {{RFC5277}} used by YANG Push {{RFC8641}}.

- There is a lot more alignment in data model, behavior, and state machined in YANG Push Lite, aiming to minimize differences.

- Changes to handling receivers:

  - Receivers are always configured separately from the subscription and are referenced.

  - Transport and Encoding parameters are configured as part of a receiver definition, and are used by all subscriptions directed towards a given receiver.

  - Encoding is now a mandatory parameter under a receiver and dynamic subscription (rather than specifying a default).

  - If a subscription uses multiple receivers then:

    - Update messages and lifecycle notifications are sent to all receivers (to preserve sequence numbers)

    - all receivers must be configured with the same encoding

  - Invoking the *reset* RPC operation on a receiver requires and forces a reset of any transport sessions associated with that receiver.  Previously, the sessions would not be reset if they were used by other subscriptions.

- Periodic and on-change message uses a common *update* notification message format, allowing for the messages to be processed by clients in a similar fashion and to support combined periodic and on-change subscriptions.

- Changes related to the configuration model:

  - Subscriptions are primarily identified by a string identifier rather than a numeric identifier.

  - Purpose has been renamed to Description (since it is a more generic term), limited to 1k characters, but also available for dynamic subscriptions.

- On-change dampening:

  - Client configurable on-change dampening has been removed.

  - However, YANG Push Lite allows a publisher to limit the rate at which a data node is sampled for on-change notifications.  See {{OnChangeConsiderations}} for further details.

- Dynamic subscriptions are no longer mandatory to implement, either or both of Configured and Dynamic Subscriptions may be implemented in YANG Push Lite.

- The solution focuses solely on datastore subscriptions that each have their own event stream.  Filters cannot be applied to the event stream, only to the set of datastore data nodes that are monitored by the subscription.

- The lifecycle events of when a subscription-started or subscription-terminated may be sent differs from RFC 8639/RFC 8649:

  - Subscription-started notifications are also sent for dynamic subscriptions.

- Some of the requirements on transport have been relaxed.

- The encoding identities have been extended with CBOR encodings, and the "encoding-" prefix has been removed (so that there is a better on the wire representation).

- YANG Push Lite allows for a publisher to provide an eventually consistent distributed view of the operational datastore, rather than a fully consistent datastore where on-change updates are sent as logic diffs to that datastore.

## Added Functionality

- Device capabilities are reported via XXX and additional models that augment that data model.

- A new *update* message:

  - Covers both on-change and periodic events.

  - Allows multiple updates to be sent in a single message (e.g., for on-change).

  - Allows for a common path prefix to be specified, with any paths and encoded YANG data to be encoded relative to the common path prefix.

- A *collection-complete* notification, and associated configuration, has been defined to inform collectors when a subscription's periodic collection cycle is complete.

- TODO - More operational data on the subscription load and performance.

- All YANG Push Lite configuration is under a new *datastore-telemetry* presence container

# Subscription Errors (from RFC 8641)

## RPC Failures

Rejection of an RPC for any reason is indicated via an RPC error
response from the publisher.  Valid RPC errors returned include both
(1) existing transport-layer RPC error codes, such as those seen with
NETCONF in [RFC6241] and (2) subscription-specific errors, such as
those defined in the YANG data model.  As a result, how subscription
errors are encoded in an RPC error response is transport dependent.

References to specific identities in the ietf-subscribed-
notifications YANG module [RFC8639] or the ietf-yang-push YANG module
may be returned as part of the error responses resulting from failed
attempts at datastore subscription.  For errors defined as part of
the ietf-subscribed-notifications YANG module, please refer to
[RFC8639].  The errors defined in this document, grouped per RPC, are
as follows:

~~~~
      establish-subscription          modify-subscription
      ---------------------------     ---------------------
       cant-exclude                    period-unsupported
       datastore-not-subscribable      update-too-big
       on-change-unsupported           sync-too-big
       on-change-sync-unsupported      unchanging-selection
       period-unsupported
       update-too-big                 resync-subscription
       sync-too-big                   ----------------------------
       unchanging-selection            no-such-subscription-resync
                                       sync-too-big
~~~~

There is one final set of transport-independent RPC error elements
included in the YANG data model.  These are the four yang-data
structures for failed datastore subscriptions:

1.  yang-data "establish-subscription-error-datastore": This MUST be
    returned if information identifying the reason for an RPC error
    has not been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a
    failed "establish-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent
    if hints are included.

2.  yang-data "modify-subscription-error-datastore": This MUST be
    returned if information identifying the reason for an RPC error
    has not been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a
    failed "modify-subscription" RPC response.  This MUST be sent if
    hints are included.

3.  yang-data "sn:delete-subscription-error": This MUST be returned
    if information identifying the reason for an RPC error has not
    been placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
    "delete-subscription" or "kill-subscription" RPC response.

4.  yang-data "resync-subscription-error": This MUST be returned if
    information identifying the reason for an RPC error has not been
    placed elsewhere in the transport portion of a failed
    "resync-subscription" RPC response.

## Failure Notifications
A subscription may be unexpectedly terminated or suspended
independently of any RPC or configuration operation.  In such cases,
indications of such a failure MUST be provided.  To accomplish this,
a number of errors can be returned as part of the corresponding
subscription state change notification.  For this purpose, the
following error identities are introduced in this document, in
addition to those that were already defined in [RFC8639]:

~~~~
  subscription-terminated        subscription-suspended
  ---------------------------    ----------------------
  datastore-not-subscribable     period-unsupported
  unchanging-selection           update-too-big
                                  synchronization-size

# Examples {#Examples}

Notes on examples:

- To allow for programmatic validation, most notification examples in this section exclude the mandatory notification envelope and associated metadata defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-notif-envelope}}.  Only the full notification example in {{FullNotificationExample}} includes the notification header.

- These notification message examples are given using a JSON encoding, but could be encoded using XML or CBOR.

- Some additional meta data fields, e.g., like those defined in {{?I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing}} would also likely be included, but have also been excluded to allow for slightly more concise examples.

- The examples include the {{?I-D.tgraf-netconf-yang-push-observation-time}} field for the existing YANG-Push Notification format, and the proposed equivalent "observation-time" leaf for the new update notification format.

- All these examples are created by hand, may contain errors, and may not parse correctly.

## Example of periodic update messages

In this example, a subscription is for */ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface*.  However, for efficiency reasons, the publisher is internally returning the data from two different data providers.

Of note:

- The first periodic message is published for the entries in the */ietf-interfaces:interface/interfaces* list, but doesn't contain the data in the *statistics* child container.
- the *path-prefix* is to the subscription subtree, since the device will never return data outside of the subscription subtree.
- the *target-path* is elided because the data is returned at the subscription point. **TODO, or should it actually be to the element above? **

~~~~ JSON
{::include examples/yang/notifications/periodic-update.json}
~~~~
{: align="left" sourcecode-name="periodic-update.json" title="Example periodic update for interfaces list"}

For the second notification related to the same subscription:

- the second periodic message is published for only the statistics associated with the interfaces.
- as above, the *path-prefix* is still to the subscription subtree.
- the second notification uses a separate observation-time, but would use the same event-time in the notification header so that the two messages can be correlated to the same periodic collection event.
- the second periodic message has set the *complete* flag to indicate that it is the last notification as part of the periodic collection.  A separate *update-complete* notification could have been sent instead.

## Example of an on-change-update notification using the new style update message

If the subscription is for on-change notifications, or periodic-and-on-change-notifications, then, if the interface state changed (specifically if the 'state' leaf of the interface changed state), and if the device was capable of generating on-change notifications, then you may see the following message.  A few points of notes here:

- The on-change notification contains **all** of the state at the "target-path"

  - Not present in the below example, but if the notification excluded some state under an interfaces list entry (e.g., the line-state leaf) then this would logically represent the implicit deletion of that field under the given list entry.

  - In this example it is restricted to a single interface. It could also publish an on-change notification for all interfaces, by indicating a target-path without any keys specified.  TODO - Can it represent notifications for a subset of interfaces?

- The schema of the change message is exactly the same as for the equivalent periodic message.  It doesn't use the YANG Patch format {{RFC8072}} for on-change messages.

- The "observation time" leaf represents when the system first observed the on-change event occurring.

- The on-change event doesn't differentiate the type of change to operational state.  The on-change-update snapshot type is used to indicate the creation of a new entry or some update to some existing state.  Basically, the message can be thought of as the state existing with some current value.

## Example of an on-change-delete notification using the new style update message


### Update message with single deleted data node

If the interface was deleted, and if the system was capable of reporting on-change events for the delete event, then an on-change delete message would be encoded as per the following message.

Of note:

- The ietf-yp-notification:envelope has been elided
- The deleted data is identified by the target node in the *updates/target-path* element.
- The observation time represents the time at which the delete event occurred, e.g., perhaps when the system processed a configuration change.

~~~~
{: align="left" sourcecode-name="on-change-delete-msg.json" title="Example YANG Push Lite on-change delete message"}


### Update message with multiple on-change deletes

This follow example illustrates how a single update notification message can contain multiple on-change delete events for different data nodes.  In this example, two separate interfaces are being deleted.

Of note:

- The ietf-yp-notification:envelope has been elided
- *prefix-path* is used to shorten the target-paths, the full paths can be constructed concatenating the *prefix-path* with each *target-path* in the *updates* list.
- all delete events share a common observation-time of when the delete events occurred.  If it is necessary to identify separate observation times then the publisher would send separate messages.
- data node subtrees that are deleted (list entries in this case) are identified by separate entries in the *updates* list.

## NETCONF Dynamic Subscription RPC examples

The examples in this section illustrate NETCONF RPCs for establishing and deleting dynamic subscriptions using Yang Push Lite.  The examples include one successfully establishing a subscription, and a second to illustrate how errors are returned if a request to establish the subscription fails.  Examples of the *update* and subscription lifecycle notifications have been given in the previous section.

### Successful periodic subscription

The subscriber sends an "establish-subscription" RPC with the parameters listed in {{EstablishDynamic}}  An example might look like:

~~~~ XML
{::include examples/netconf/rpc/netconf-establish-sub-if-stats.xml}
~~~~
{: align="left" sourcecode-name="netconf-establish-sub-if-stats.xml" title="Example establish-subscription RPC for interface statistics"}

If a publisher is happy to accept the subscription, then it returns a positive response that includes the "id" of the accepted subscription.  For example,

~~~~ XML
{::include examples/netconf/rpc/establish-subscription-reply.xml}
~~~~
{: align="left" sourcecode-name="establish-subscription-reply.xml" title="Example establish-subscription RPC successful reply"}

Once established, the publisher would send a *subscription-started* notification message followed by *update* notification messages at the requested periodic cadence.

### Failed periodic subscription

A subscription can be rejected for multiple reasons, including the
lack of authorization to establish a subscription, no capacity to
serve the subscription at the publisher, or the inability of the
publisher to select datastore content at the requested cadence.

If a request is rejected because the publisher is not able to serve
it, the publisher SHOULD include in the returned error hints that
help a subscriber understand what subscription parameters might have
been accepted for the request.  These hints would be included in the
yang-data structure "establish-subscription-error-datastore".
However, even with these hints, there are no guarantees that
subsequent requests will in fact be accepted.

The specific parameters to be returned as part of the RPC error
response depend on the specific transport that is used to manage the
subscription.  For NETCONF, those parameters are defined in
{{RFC8640}}.  For example, for the following NETCONF request:

~~~~
  <rpc message-id="101"
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <establish-subscription
        xmlns=
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"
        xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
      <yp:datastore
          xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores">
        ds:operational
      </yp:datastore>
      <yp:datastore-xpath-filter
          xmlns:ex="https://example.com/sample-data/1.0">
        /ex:foo
      </yp:datastore-xpath-filter>
      <yp:on-change>
      </yp:on-change>
    </establish-subscription>
  </rpc>

      Figure 12: "establish-subscription" Request: Example 2
~~~~

A publisher that cannot serve on-change updates but can serve
periodic updates might return the following NETCONF response:

~~~~
 <rpc-reply message-id="101"
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
   xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications">
   <rpc-error>
     <error-type>application</error-type>
     <error-tag>operation-failed</error-tag>
     <error-severity>error</error-severity>
     <error-path>/yp:periodic/yp:period</error-path>
     <error-info>
       <yp:establish-subscription-error-datastore>
         <yp:reason>yp:on-change-unsupported</yp:reason>
       </yp:establish-subscription-error-datastore>
     </error-info>
   </rpc-error>
 </rpc-reply>

###  "delete-subscription" RPC

To stop receiving updates from a subscription and effectively delete
a subscription that had previously been established using an
"establish-subscription" RPC, a subscriber can send a
"delete-subscription" RPC, which takes as its only input the
subscription's "id".  This RPC is unmodified from [RFC8639].

# Summary of Open Issues & Potential Enhancements {#OpenIssuesTracker}

This temporary section lists open issues and enhancements that require further discussion by the authors, or the WG.  Once adopted, it is anticipated that tracking the open issues would move to github.

The issues are ordered/grouped by the sections in the current document.  I.e., to make it easier to review/update sections of the document.

## Issues related to general IETF process

1. If this work progresses we will need simple bis versions of the transports document so that they augment into the new data model paths.  Drafts that would need to be updated as documented in  {{DraftRelationships}}.  [Issue 27](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/27)

1. Do we need to fold in any text from RFC 8640? and RESTCONF? [Issue 26](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/26)

1. What is the right protocol (and document) name.  Should we be calling this Yang Push 2 (YPv2) to more clearly indicate that this is intended to be a replacement for Yang Push? [Issue 25](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/25)

## Issue related to Terminology/Definitions

1. Should we use the object terminology? Tracked as editorial, in [Issue 15](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/15)


## Issues related to YANG Push Lite Overview

None currently.

## Issues related to Subscription Paths and Selection Filters

1. This draft introduces a new simple yang path (ypath) format that is like a JSON instance data path, that all implementations MUST support.  [Issue 29](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/29)

1. Advertising subscription schema: [Issue 11](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/11)

## Issues related to Datastore Event Streams & message format

1. Agree format and usage of *update* notification. [Issue 32](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/32)


## Issues related to Receivers, Transports, & Encodings

### Constraints on supporting multiple receivers:

1. Encoding is set per receiver, but do we need to support a subscription supporting more than one receiver with different encodings? Tracked as part of [Issue 17](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/17)

1. Do we need a per-receiver notification to indicate to a specific receiver that it has been disconnected? [Issue 28](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/28)

### Issues related to Transports:

1. {{transports}} lists quite a lot of rules on what are valid transports and what negotiation/etc is required.  I think we need to check whether we can weaken some of these (although it is possible that these were imposed during a transport directorate review).
    - **Rob: Authors, I've updated the transport section, {{transports}}, please can you re-review.**. Tracked as part of [Issue 17](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/17)

1. James: We also need to add some text into security section.
   - Rob: Is this transport specific, or related to application layer authorization?

1. What is the rules/restrictions for subscription receiver instances vs transport sessions?  E.g., is this entirely down to the transport to define.

## Issues related to Setting up & Managing Subscriptions

### Issues related to the configuration model:

1. YP Lite is somewhat different (separate namespace, separate receivers, no event filters, some config has moved to a separate receivers list).  See the data model and {{DifferencesFromYangPush}}.  Note some of these apply or impact dynamic subscriptions as well. [Issue 30](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/30)


### Issues related to dynamic subscriptions:

1. Do we want to change how RPC errors are reported?  E.g., change the RPC ok response to indicate whether the subscription was successfully created or not, or included extra error information.  Note NETCONF and RESTCONF already define how errors are encoded in XML and JSON (for RESTCONF only), is it possible to unify this so we don't need large extra separate documents.

## Issues related to Subscription Lifecycle

1. Use subscription name as the unique identifier for the subscription configuration.  Subscription id identifies a subscription session.  I.e., if a configured subscription is terminated and re-established then a new subscription id is allocated. [Issue 19](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/19)

1. Should subscription-started notification include a fingerprint of the schema that is covered by the subscription that would guaranteed to change if the subscription changes? [Issue 11](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/11)

1. If a subscription references a filter, then should that be included inline in the subscription started notification (as per the RFC 8641 text), or should it indicate that it is a referenced filter? [Issue 20](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/20)

1. When a subscription is terminated, should it be MUST NOT send any more notifications after the terminated message, or SHOULD NOT?  For a dynamic subscription, should the RPC be synchronous and not reply until it knows that all queues have been drained? [Issue 13](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/13)

1. Is a publisher allowed to arbitrarily send a sync-on-start resync, e.g., if it detects data loss, or should it always just terminate and reinitialize the subscription? [Issue 22](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/22)

1. Should we have a YANG Action to reset a receiver or a subscription?  E.g., discussed in {{reset}}. [Issue 24](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/24)

1. Should we support configurable subscription-level keepalives? [Issue 14](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/14)

## Issues related to Performance, Reliability & Subscription Monitoring

### Issues/questions related to operational data:

1. Should we define some additional operational data to help operators check that the telemetry infrastructure is performing correctly, to get an approximation of the load, etc.
   - Rob: probably, but lower priority.
   - Tracked by [Issue 31](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/31)

1. Should dynamic subscriptions use the same receivers structure as for configured subscriptions, or should they be inline in the configured subscription?  Also tracked by [Issue 31](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/31)

## Issues related to Conformance and Capabilities

1. Do we advertise that conformance via capabilities and/or YANG features (both for configured and dynamic subscriptions)?
1. For on-change, should a subscription be rejected (or not brought up) if there are no on-change notifiable nodes?
1. Further work and discussion is required for advertising capabilities for filter paths.  E.g., listing all of the paths that support on-change could be a very long list.  Related, does the draft need to advertise at what points a publisher would decompose a higher subscription into more specific subscriptions.

All tracked via [Issue 18](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/18)

## Issues related to the YANG Modules

None open.

## Issues related to the Security Considerations (& NACM filtering)

1. Need to consider how NACM applies to YANG Push Lite, which may differ for dynamic vs configured subscription, but generally we want the permissions to be checked when the subscription is created rather than each time a path is accessed.
1. Where should this be in the document (current it in the security considerations section)

1. Do we want to retain the the current text in {{events}} introduction related to terminating a subscription if permissions change?

1. Also note, text was removed from the transport section related to RPC authorization, and which should be moved to an application (rather than transport) layer security mechanism.

All tracked via [Issue 33](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/33)

## Issues related to the IANA

None open.

## Issues related to the Appendixes

### Examples related issues/questions:

1. Not a question, but a note that many examples need to be updated to reflect the data models currently in the draft.

## Summary of closed/resolved issues

This appendix is only intended while the authors/WG are working on the document, and should be deleted prior to WG LC.

1. Rename subscription-terminated to subscription-stopped (Change rejected 21 Feb 25, unnecessary renaming.)

1. MUST use envelope, hostname and sequence-number (and event-time) (Decided 21 Feb 25)

1. Don't mandate configured or dynamic subscriptions, allow implementations to implement one or both of them. (Decided 21 Feb 25)

1. Dynamic subscriptions require the encoding to be specified. (Decided 21 Feb 25)

1. DSCP settings are only specified under the receiver (for configured subscriptions) (Decided 21 Feb 25)

1. Config and dynamic subscriptions should be aligned as much as possible.

1. If subscription parameters change then force subscription down and up again, [issue 14](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/14)

1. No RPC to modify a dynamic subscription, use delete-subscription then create-subscription.

1. Lifecycle messages (except receiver-disconnected) are sent per subscription (to all receivers) rather than per receiver.

1. Encoding is set per subscription, and we don't allow different per-receiver encodings for a subscription with more than one receiver.  [issue 17](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/17)

1. We have a updated-completed flag/notification to allow deleted data to be implicitly detected.  Something similar may be added to gNMI.  [issue 12](https://github.com/rgwilton/draft-yp-observability/issues/12)
